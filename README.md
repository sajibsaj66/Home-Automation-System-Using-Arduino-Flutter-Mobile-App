# Smart-Home-Automation-System-Using-Arduino-Flutter-Mobile-App

A new Flutter project.

## Introduction

Our project is a Smart Home Automation System that leverages modern IoT technologies to enhance convenience, energy efficiency, and safety. By automating lighting and door mechanisms, we aim to address inefficiencies and challenges faced in traditional manual systems. This system especially benefits the elderly and people with disabilities, offering independence and ease of use.

## Objectives
Automated Door Entry: Doors open automatically when a user approaches, using an IR sensor to detect the presence of a servo motor for door operation.
Entry/Exit Lighting: Lights turn on when entering a room and off when exiting, using a PIR sensor to detect occupancy.
Mood-Based Lighting: RGB LEDs allow users to customize lighting colors based on mood or preferences, and they can be controlled via the mobile app.
Eldercare Accessibility: Empower paralyzed or disabled individuals to control lights and fans using the mobile application.
Mobile Application Control: The app communicates with the system via Wi-Fi (ESP8266) to enable full control of lights, fans, and other features.
Fan Control: Users can turn the fan on/off through the app, similar to lighting controls.

## Technologies and Sensors Used
IR Sensors: Detect user presence near the door for automated entry.
PIR Sensors: Monitor room occupancy to trigger lighting.
Servo Motors: Operate door mechanisms for automated entry.
ESP8266 Microcontroller: Facilitates communication between the sensors and mobile app.
RGB LED Lights: Provide customizable lighting based on user preferences.
Mobile Application: Acts as the primary user interface for controlling all aspects of the system.

By integrating these components, our system offers a comprehensive solution for smart home automation, improving quality of life while ensuring energy efficiency and adaptability.
